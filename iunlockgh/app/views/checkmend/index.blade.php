With the Phone IMEI Blacklist Check you will be able to find out whether your phone has been reported lost, stolen or simply blocked by your service provider.

If you are planning to buy a second hand phone you better check its IMEI before. If the IMEI was ever reported lost or stolen you might not be able to use it in your country.
